## Description:
- This node.js package allows users to create a professional website that has all of your team members roles and contact information based off your user input in the Terminal or CLI. 
### Why This Project Was Made:
- People who are part of management in a company could use this package to quickly create a webpage with good aesthetics where anyone in the company or the open market could access their employee's position and contact details. 
        
## Installation:
- Simply clone the repository into your computer via CLI or terminal, navigate into the folder, and run node index.js
